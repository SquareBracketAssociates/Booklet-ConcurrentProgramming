The section might want to state some thing like "there that the current
implementation of the Pharo scheduler has process priorities from 1 to
100.  Only some of these are named.  But the programmer is free to use any
priority within that range that they see fit."  It would be good to include
examples which did things like "forkAt: Processor userPriority + 1", etc.

In the label for Fig 2.1 "ressources" should read "resources".  But
throughout that section I would word it that "processes need to share
resources", but "the process is waiting to acquire the resource".  So use
the plural for the general case and the singular for the specific case.
Sentences such as this: "P0 has finished to use the resources." should read
"P0 has finished using the resource."


Most of the paragraphs on page 49 in section 4.5 are still in French and
need translating.
