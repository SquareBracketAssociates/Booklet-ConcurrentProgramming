This book describes the low-level abstractions available in Pharo for concurrent programming. It explains pedagogically different aspects. Now, if you happen to create many green threads \(called Process in Pharo\) we suggest that you have a look at TaskIt. TaskIt is an extensible library to manage concurrent processing at a higher level of abstraction. You should definitely have a look at it. We did several iterations and integrated many feedback and we want to thank all the reviewers. Still, we are interested in typos, English corrections,potential mistakes or any kind of feedback. You can simply contact us at stephane.ducasse@inria.fr18 February  2020.Thanks DiagProf, Eliot Miranda, Sven Van Caekenberghe, and Ben Coman for their feedback, ideas, and suggestions.Thank you again.
